# Electoral Framing in U.S. Historical Newspapers (1930–1945)


This project utilizes the American Stories dataset, a structured historical newspaper dataset 
corpus developed by Melissa Dell and collaborators, to investigate the relationship 
between media sentiment and electoral behavior in the United States from 1930 to 1945.
By using Dell’s enhanced pipeline, we gain access to a cleaner, more legible, and highly 
structured dataset of full-text newspaper articles from cities and rural communities alike.



# Research Focus

This project aims to quantify the influence of newspaper tone and vocabulary on electoral support for 
Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) across the 1932–1944 election cycles. Specifically, it examines:

1. General sentiment analysis of pre-election media coverage
2. The framing of political and economic language.
3. Regional variation in media tone and its impact on voting behavior


# Project Contribution
This project contributes empirical evidence to the long-standing hypothesis that media framing influences 
electoral behavior. By leveraging large-scale structured historical data, it sheds light on how sentiment, 
political vocabulary, and economic discourse impacted voter choices during one of the most turbulent eras in 
American history. It also underscores the critical role of methodological design in computational media studies, 
with implications for political economy, communication, and historical NLP.

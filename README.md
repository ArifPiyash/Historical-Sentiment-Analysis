How did American Newspapers between 1930 to 1945 portray the impact of events 
like the Great Depression (1930-38), the First New Deal (1933-36), the Second New Deal(1937-40),
and the War Period (1941-46)?  This study uses the American Stories dataset to empirically analyze 
the discourse on the Great Depression and reforms undertaken by governments in regional and national
newspapers. Furthermore, words used by newspapers and their impact on regional and national election 
outcomes. Newspapers are extracted from the dataset, and each of them is assigned a region.
